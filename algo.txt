Given:
1. City, Street, Avenue, Value
2. Day, City, Desired time, Start hour, End hour

Objective:
Maximize sum of values of cities visited

How to do it:
1. Create a list of cities for each day
2. Plot them out on a 2d plane
3. Add a 3rd dimension - time - with start and end hours
4. Now we have lines in a 3d plane. Try to form clusters using these lines. How? Try to ensure that each cluster has similar value and that a cluster has lines closer in space and time
5. For each day you would have a set of clusters. The # of clusters would be the one with which the entropy is minimized.
6. Now, iterate over the all possible combinations of the clusters over all the days and select top few feasible combinations with the highest values
7. Now, for each combination, for each cluster, run a greedy algorithm over the cluster that chooses the nearest city
8. Select the best one from all the combinations, return it as the answer
